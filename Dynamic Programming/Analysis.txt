Minimizing Coins:
Counting Problem
Notably, there is a certain problem with using INT_MAX as the identity for the min law of composition:
    min: (Z mod (2^32)Z))^2 -> Z mod (2^31-1)Z) 
    min: (a, INT_MAX)|-> a

In that if you ever want to use INT_MAX + some constant, then it rolls over to the 
negative integers and then the min values become some negative shit.
